			<h1>Hello, I'm Tancrede. </h1>
			<img src="imagetancrede/tancredeprofil.PNG" alt="Tancrede Dib" height="150px" class="img-circle">
			<p>Born in London but raised as a French child, I have been able to experience a multicultural childhood whilst learning to speak both languages. This has given me the envy to travel in order to experience new cultures. Although I am still unsure about what I want to do when I'm older, I strive to live my life in the most fulfilling way. My goal is to make the most positive change possible during my life. </p>

			<h2>Travels üåç</h2>
				<p>The two weeks I spent in Japan durig the spring of 2017 was the most breathtakig weeks of my life. The strongly preserved Japanese culture and strong contrast between moderity, nature and history makes it all the more interesting. I hope to live in Japan in the future in order to fully imerse myself in this peculiar culture.</p>

			<h2>Sports üõπ</h2>
			<p>Playig a sport at a high level has been one of the most formatig experiences throughout my life. Tennis allowed me to learn how competition works and gave me a self cotrol i struggled to obtain. Even though I have stopped playing at a competitive level, I still thoroughly enjoy playing when I get the opportunity as it empties my head and keep my heart pumping.</p>

			<h2>Music üìù</h2>
			<p>Although neither of my parents are musicians, I grew up in a musical environment thanks to the varied music taste my parents had. I therfore was able to develop my music taste and imerse myself in music. Playing piano for 3 years also made me understand the working of music on a deeper level and allowed me to enjoy it even more. I strongly beleive that music is important to all human brains as it stimulates differet parts of it while relaxing the rest. This is especially true for classical music which is seen by many as the language of the gods. 
				Here is a link to a radio I listened to most of my childhood in the car everyday.
